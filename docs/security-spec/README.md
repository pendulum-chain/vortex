# Vortex Security Specification

This directory contains the security specification for the Vortex cross-border payment platform. Each file defines the **intended behavior** of a system module — the invariants that must hold, the threats that must be mitigated, and the concrete checks an auditor should perform against the actual code.

## Purpose

1. **Audit baseline** — During code review, each spec file acts as the source of truth for "how it should work." Any deviation between code and spec is a finding.
2. **Future development reference** — Engineers and AI agents can read these specs to understand security expectations before modifying a module.
3. **Extensibility** — New integrations, chains, or features should get a corresponding spec file before implementation.

## How to Use

- **For auditing:** Walk through the Audit Checklist in each file. Every unchecked box is a gap.
- **For development:** Before changing a module, read its spec. If your change would violate an invariant, update the spec first (with review).
- **For new integrations:** Copy `05-integrations/_template.md` and fill it in for the new provider.

## Per-File Format

Every spec file uses exactly four sections:

- **What This Does** — Brief overview, scope, why it matters for security.
- **Security Invariants** — Numbered, testable MUST-hold properties. The core of the spec.
- **Threat Vectors & Mitigations** — Attack → Defense pairs. Realistic scenarios for a financial platform.
- **Audit Checklist** — Concrete checkboxes to verify against actual code.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Ramp** | A conversion between fiat and crypto (on-ramp = fiat→crypto, off-ramp = crypto→fiat) |
| **Ephemeral account** | A temporary blockchain account created per ramp, used for signing transactions, then discarded |
| **Phase** | A discrete step in the ramp state machine (e.g., `nablaSwap`, `spacewalkRedeem`) |
| **Nabla** | DEX on Pendulum used for token swaps |
| **Spacewalk** | Bridge between Pendulum and Stellar |
| **XCM** | Cross-Consensus Messaging — the cross-chain transfer protocol between Polkadot parachains |
| **BRLA** | Brazilian Real stablecoin anchor (BRL on/off-ramp) |
| **Monerium** | EUR stablecoin issuer (EUR on-ramp via SEPA) |
| **Alfredpay** | Fiat payment provider supporting multiple currencies |
| **Squid Router** | Cross-chain swap/routing protocol for EVM chains |
| **Subsidization** | When the platform tops up an ephemeral account to ensure the user receives the quoted amount |
| **pk\_/sk\_** | Public key / Secret key prefixes for the dual API key system |
| **PIX** | Brazilian instant payment system |
