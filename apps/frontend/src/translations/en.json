These are all-in fees, meaning there are no hidden charges from Vortex or local banking partners. The cost of your transfer comes from the clearly disclosed fee and exchange rate. Unlike many providers that claim \"no fees\" but hide extra costs in inflated exchange rates, Vortex ensures you're never overcharged. Our fees are shown upfront so you always know exactly what you're paying.",

We recommend double-checking your submission to ensure a smooth process.",
