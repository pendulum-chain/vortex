        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>3.1</strong> Vortex provides a technical aggregation and routing layer that displays Quotes from Partners for
          fiat-crypto and crypto-fiat Transactions and enables the technical initiation, routing and status tracking of such
          Transactions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>3.2</strong> Vortex is <strong>not</strong> a bank, payment institution, e-money institution, exchange,
          investment firm, broker, custodian, or wallet provider, and does not provide legal, tax or investment advice.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>3.3</strong> The fiat-crypto conversion and any related payment or payout are executed by a Partner, through a
          decentralized exchange, but not by Vortex. The Partner acts as merchant of record and is responsible for KYC/AML,
          transaction monitoring and regulatory compliance for its leg of the Transaction.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>3.4</strong> Vortex does <strong>not</strong>:

          <li>guarantee execution of any Order or performance of any Partner.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>3.5</strong> Vortex may modify, suspend or discontinue parts of the Services, supported assets, payment
          methods or Partners at any time, where required for legal, regulatory, security or operational reasons.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>3.6</strong> Certain features or jurisdictions may be offered only in cooperation with one or more specific
          Partners and may be subject to additional terms, eligibility criteria or regulatory requirements.

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>8.1</strong> Digital Assets and related activities involve significant <strong>risks</strong>, including the
          risk of loss of some or all of the value of your holdings. Before using the Services, you should carefully consider
          whether you can afford to lose any amounts involved.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>8.2</strong> Without limitation, you acknowledge the following risks:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          <strong>(a) Market and volatility risk</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Digital Asset and FX markets are highly volatile. Prices can move rapidly and unexpectedly, and Digital Assets may
          lose all or most of their value.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          <strong>(b) Technology and network risk</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Digital Assets rely on blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies. There may be bugs, vulnerabilities,
          forks, network congestion, delays, failed transactions, double-spends or other technical issues.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          <strong>(c) Irreversibility and user error</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Transactions on many blockchains are generally <strong>irreversible</strong> once confirmed. If you provide an
          incorrect address, select the wrong network, send to an unsupported asset or contract, or otherwise make an error, you
          may permanently lose the funds involved.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          <strong>(d) Regulatory and legal risk</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Laws and regulations relating to Digital Assets and fiat-crypto conversions are evolving and may change quickly. New
          rules may:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-disc space-y-2">
          <li>restrict, prohibit or impose new obligations on the Services or specific assets; or</li>

          <strong>(e) Counterparty and credit risk</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Banks, card issuers, PSPs, Partners and other intermediaries may experience operational issues, financial
          difficulties, regulatory restrictions or insolvency. Their failure could result in delays, losses or inability to
          complete Transactions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          <strong>(f) Security risk</strong>
