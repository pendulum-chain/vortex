# Adding support for Avenia's API v2 API

## Context
Migrating to Avenia's API v2 is essential for leveraging improved features and functionality that the v2 API offers. The integration guide outlines numerous enhancements over the v1 API, including better performance, new endpoints, and additional data formats. By transitioning to v2, we can ensure that our application remains up-to-date with Avenia's latest capabilities, providing a more robust and efficient experience for our users.

## TODO
1. Review the v2 documentation thoroughly.
2. Audit current usage of the v1 API within the application.
3. Refactor application logic to utilize v2 endpoints instead of v1.
4. Update existing tests and documentation to reflect changes made during the migration.
5. Verify that all features function correctly with the new v2 API.
6. Remove any deprecated logic related to the v1 API.
