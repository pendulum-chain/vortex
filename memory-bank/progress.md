# Progress: Pendulum Pay Backend Migration

## What Works

1. **Database Integration**

   - ✅ PostgreSQL connection configuration
   - ✅ Database models (QuoteTicket, RampState, IdempotencyKey, Partner, ApiKey)
   - ✅ Database migrations
   - ✅ Model associations (Partner ↔ ApiKey)

2. **API Endpoints**

   - ✅ Quote creation and retrieval
   - ✅ Ramping process initiation
   - ✅ Status polling
   - ✅ Phase and state updates
   - ✅ Admin API key management endpoints

3. **Service Layer**

   - ✅ Base service with common functionality
   - ✅ Quote service for quote generation
   - ✅ Ramp service for ramping process management
   - ✅ Transaction validation

4. **Background Processing**
   - ✅ Cleanup worker for expired quotes
   - ✅ Cleanup worker for expired idempotency keys

5. **Authentication & Security**
   - ✅ API key authentication system
   - ✅ Partner discount protection
   - ✅ Bcrypt-based key hashing
   - ✅ Optional authentication middleware
   - ✅ Partner-payload validation
   - ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
   - ✅ Admin endpoint protection (Bearer token)
   - ✅ Constant-time comparison for security

## What's Left to Build

1. **Frontend Integration**

   - ❌ Modify transaction signing process
   - ❌ Implement status polling

2. **Testing**

   - ❌ Unit tests for services
   - ❌ Integration tests for API endpoints
   - ❌ End-to-end tests for ramping flows

3. **Deployment**

   - ❌ Set up PostgreSQL in production
   - ❌ Deploy updated backend
   - ❌ Monitor system

4. **Documentation**
   - ❌ Update API documentation
   - ❌ Create developer guides
   - ❌ Document database schema

## Known Issues

1. **Quote Calculation**

   - The current quote calculation is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with actual exchange rate logic
   - We need to integrate with external price oracles for accurate quotes

2. **Transaction Validation**

   - The transaction validation logic needs to be enhanced to verify that the transactions match the expected parameters
   - We need to add more robust error handling for invalid transactions

3. **Error Handling**

   - The error handling in the API endpoints could be improved
   - We need to add more detailed error messages and logging

4. **Performance**

   - The performance of the database queries has not been optimized
   - We may need to add indexes for frequently accessed fields

5. **Security**
   - ✅ API key authentication implemented for partner discounts
   - ❌ Rate limiting for API endpoints still needed


## Frontend Progress (Vortex - Based on Codebase Analysis)

**Completed Components/Features:**
- ✅ Core application setup (`main.tsx`, `app.tsx`, `index.html`)
- ✅ Basic layout (`Navbar`, `Footer`, `BaseLayout`)
- ✅ Swap page UI (`SwapPage`, `Swap` component, `AssetNumericInput`, `FeeCollapse`)
- ✅ Landing page sections (`PitchSection`, `TrustedBy`, `WhyVortex`, `HowToSell`, `PopularTokens`, `FAQAccordion`, `GotQuestions`)
- ✅ Network selection UI (`NetworkSelector`, `NetworkIcon`)
- ✅ Wallet connection UI (`ConnectWalletButton`, EVM/Polkadot variants, `PolkadotWalletSelectorDialog`)
- ✅ Context providers for core services (Network, Wallets, Events, SIWE, Polkadot Nodes)
- ✅ Zustand stores for form, offramp, SEP-24, Safe wallet state
- ✅ Basic UI components (`Dialog`, `Button`, `Input`, `Accordion`, `Spinner`, etc.)
- ✅ BRLA KYC form components (`BrlaComponents`)
- ✅ User rating component (`Rating`)
- ✅ Sentry and Google Tag Manager integration
- ✅ Helper functions for formatting, calculations, storage, etc.
- ✅ Basic contract ABIs included (`ERC20`, `ERC20Wrapper`, `Router`, `SquidReceiver`)

**Inferred Pending/In-Progress:**
- ⏳ Full integration of swap logic with backend API (Quote, Ramp Start, Status)
- ⏳ Complete implementation of transaction signing and submission flow for all ramp types
- ⏳ Robust handling of backend state machine updates and transitions in the UI
- ⏳ Comprehensive error display and handling for API/blockchain issues
- ⏳ End-to-end testing for all supported ramp flows
- ⏳ Finalization of BRLA KYC flow integration and testing
- ⏳ Potential refinement of state management interactions between Zustand and Context

[2025-04-04 16:49:09] - Added frontend progress summary based on codebase analysis.

[2025-10-29 09:03:00] - Implemented API key authentication system (Phases 1-4):
  - Created api_keys database table and migration
  - Implemented ApiKey model with Partner associations
  - Built authentication middleware (apiKeyAuth, enforcePartnerAuth)
  - Created admin endpoints for API key management
  - Integrated authentication into quote routes
  - Added bcrypt dependency for secure key hashing
  - System maintains backward compatibility while securing partner discounts

[2025-10-29 09:17:00] - Enhanced API key system with environment-based prefixes:
  - Added admin authentication with Bearer token (ADMIN_SECRET)
  - Implemented constant-time comparison for security
  - Added environment-based key generation (test vs live prefixes)
  - Keys automatically use 'vrtx_test_' prefix in sandbox (SANDBOX_ENABLED=true)
  - Keys automatically use 'vrtx_live_' prefix in production (SANDBOX_ENABLED=false)
  - Updated .env.example with documentation
